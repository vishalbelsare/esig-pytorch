# Log_Signatures

In this repo we present various tools to calculate the log-signature of a path. In particular:

1) Reutenauer.ipynb contains a code based explanation of Reutenauer's "free Lee algebras"

2) Sparsity Heat-maps.ipynb presents experiments done with various ways of calculating the log-signature and analyse sparsity of the projections Tensor2Lie and Lie2Tensor

3) We also propose the re-write of the esig package in pytorch (beta)
